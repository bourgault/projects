He grew up in an            environment where every member of his family played a            musical instrument. R&eacute;al began by practicing on            the drums at the age of nine, but his thirst for learning            didn't stop there. He went on to learn how to play the            family piano and his brother's guitar.</B></FONT></DT>                        <DT>&nbsp;</DT>                        <DT><IMG SRC="graphics/bullet.gif" WIDTH=6 HEIGHT=6 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom><FONT COLOR="#663300"><B>            In 1986, R&eacute;al became acquainted with an            international variety performer, Michel Lauzi&egrave;re.            Michel had such an impact on R&eacute;al's artistic            endeavors that, even today, R&eacute;al still considers            him one of the most talented, multi-disciplinary and            humorists of our time.</B></FONT></DT>                        <DT>&nbsp;</DT>                        <DT><IMG SRC="graphics/bullet.gif" WIDTH=6 HEIGHT=6 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom><FONT COLOR="#663300"><B>            They quickly became friends and R&eacute;al worked with            Michel from 1986 to 1990 as his assistant and property            man. He discovered the world of show business during            their numerous tours and by working on many U.S. and            international stages.</B></FONT></DT>                        <DT>&nbsp;</DT>                        <DT><IMG SRC="graphics/bullet.gif" WIDTH=6 HEIGHT=6 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom><FONT COLOR="#663300"><B>            During this period, Michel taught R&eacute;al the            rudiments of the musical saw. Because of his musical            aptitude, R&eacute;al learned rapidly and left for Tokyo,            Japan, where Michel got him a two-month contract with            Disneyland. This was an enjoyable and very fulfilling            experience for R&eacute;al.</B></FONT></DT>                        <DT>&nbsp;</DT>                        <DT><IMG SRC="graphics/bullet.gif" WIDTH=6 HEIGHT=6 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom><FONT COLOR="#663300"><B>            Back to his homeland, R&eacute;al practice the art of the            musical saw as a public entertainer in the most beautiful            sites of the Old-Qu&eacute;bec City. With a growing            success, he played it for three years. However, he is            more fascinated by the celestial sound of the glasses he            first heard played by Michel Lauzi&egrave;re. R&eacute;al            saw the enormous potential that this instrument could            offer, and in 1994 he concentrated his efforts on his            first glass instrument: the glass harp. He polarized his            energies during six months to the intensive rechearch of            the ideal glass and crystal cups. By his assiduity that            he puts into his work, R&eacute;al finally concretizes            his researches and finds the adequat chromatic            disposition of the cups that he will use from now on.            This arrangment is the one that he observes to be the            most practical for the playing of his            instrument.</B></FONT></DT>                        <DT>&nbsp;</DT>                        <DT><IMG SRC="graphics/bullet.gif" WIDTH=6 HEIGHT=6 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom><FONT COLOR="#663300"><B>            In 1995, R&eacute;al advanced to another level and            acquired technological equipment: computer, sound            modulation and music programs, which enable him to fully            utilize his musical creativity. With the help of his new            equipment, he can now write his own musical adaptations            to accompany the music of his glass harp.            </B></FONT></DT>                        <DT>&nbsp;</DT>                        <DT><IMG SRC="graphics/bullet.gif" WIDTH=6 HEIGHT=6 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom><FONT COLOR="#663300"><B>            R&eacute;al continues to progress in the mastery his            glassharp, and the love that he gives to his instrument            can't be denied.
